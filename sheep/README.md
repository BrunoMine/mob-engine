**Version:** 2.1

Adds sheep to Minetest (requires Creatures MOB-Engine).
Sheep spawn only at day-time and are friendly and remain around 5 minutes in the world.
There are four different wool colors: white, grey, brown and black. 
They will follow you if you have Wheat in your hand.
Sheep have 8 HP and drop 1-2 wool when using shears or 1 when death.
To keep a live sheep just put them close to a feeder and water.
Chicken nests can be used for the birth of the chickens.
