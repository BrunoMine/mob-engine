**Version:** 2.2

Adds chicken to Minetest (requires Creatures MOB-Engine).
Chicken spawn on dirt and grass blocks, have 5 HP and are friendly. When killed or dying
they drop meat, which can be eaten or cooked and probably some feathers. Also they drop 
randomly eggs in nests, which can be thrown to spawn new chicken or fried and eaten.
To keep a live chicken just put them close to a feeder.
Sheep beds can be used for the birth of the sheep.
